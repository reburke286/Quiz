# Quiz
Week 4 Homework 

Description:
This is a quiz that uses dynamic HTML and CSS to create the questions on the page. It uses eventListeners on the buttons and quiz answer choices. It uses interval functions for the time setting. It uses counter functions for the score. It uses local storage to store the high scores even after you refresh the page. 

Installation:
I do not think this site requires any installation instructions.

Usage:
This is used for clients that need a timed quiz on their websites.
